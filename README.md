# Description PRE-
Observations:It was not possible to have the data set on the repository due to its size nor its parameters that are also
expensive enough to not be possible to have them here at GitHub



## First Part (DCGAN) 
I implemented the __DCGAN__ in the same way as the article Compressed Sensing using Generative Models suggets, the only open points are
the Epochs(I used 30) and the BatchSize(128),for now the results are not so good the Discriminator is not learning so fast as the gene-
rator , or at least these were what the results suggested(I will train again, asap)

## Second Part
Once the model is trained, i.e the generator is trained; Now we really start to implement the article
